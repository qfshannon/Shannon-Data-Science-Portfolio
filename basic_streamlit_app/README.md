# Data Science Project #1
Goal: Design a Basic Streamlit Application to Display Data

## World Happiness Explorer App
For this project, I chose to build a Streamlit app to present data from the **2019 World Happiness Report**. This user-friendly app presents an overview of the data and offers features to examine and compare happiness measures of selected countries.

## Instructions to Run the App
App can be found on [World Happiness Explorer](http://10.146.194.119:8501)


**To Open With Code:**
1. [Download zip of Shannon-Data-Science-Portfolio](https://github.com/qfshannon/Shannon-Data-Science-Portfolio/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and open in coding environment (VS Code)
2. Open the terminal and install streamlit: pip install streamlit
3. Run the Streamlit app using: streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py
