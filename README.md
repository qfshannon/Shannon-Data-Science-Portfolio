## My Projects
Project 1: Build a Streamlit App to Present a Dataset
- [View my Streamlit project](basic_streamlit_app)

  - For this project, I built an interactive Streamlit application to present and explore data from the 2019 World Happiness Report.
  - This app allows users to visualize happiness scores across countries and examine how different factors contribute to wellbeing.
  - Completing this project helped me strengthened my Python skills, visualization strategies, and experience building applications using Streamlit.
